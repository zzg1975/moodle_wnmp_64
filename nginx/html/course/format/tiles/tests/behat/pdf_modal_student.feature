Feature: PDFs can be set to open in modal windows

      | enablecompletion       | 1        | core         |

      | jsmaxstoreditems       | 0        | format_tiles |
    # We set jsmaxstoreditems to zero as otherwise when we switch between subtiles and tiles format we may not see an immediate change in display

    # Add PDF to course so student can see it in test
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I follow "Collapse all"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I wait "1" seconds
    And I expand section "1" for edit
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I wait "2" seconds
    And I add a "File" to section "1"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I wait "2" seconds
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Name        | Test PDF         |
      | Description | File description |
    And I set the field "Completion tracking" to "Students can manually mark the activity as completed"
    And I upload "course/format/tiles/tests/fixtures/test.pdf" file to "Select files" filemanager
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the field "Show type" to "1"
    And I press "Save and return to course"
    Then I should see "Test PDF"
    And I wait "2" seconds
    And I log out tiles

  @javascript
  Scenario: Teacher can restrict cm by group, and student can only see it if they are in that group
    When format_tiles subtiles are on for course "Course 1"
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I wait "1" seconds

    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I expand section "1" for edit
    And I wait "3" seconds

    And I follow "Restricted page"
    And I navigate to "Edit settings" in current page administration
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I click on "Add restriction..." "button"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I click on "Group" "button" in the "Add restriction..." "dialogue"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I set the field with xpath "//select[@name='id']" to "Group A"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I click on ".availability-item .availability-eye img" "css_element"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I press "Save and return to course"

    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I follow "Collapse all"
    And I expand section "1" for edit
    And I add a "Label" to section "1"
    And I wait "2" seconds
    And I wait until the page is ready

    And I click on ".availability-item .availability-eye img" "css_element"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I press "Save and return to course"
    And I log out tiles

     # Log back in as student.
    And I log in as "studenta"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage

    And I click on tile "1"
    And I wait until the page is ready

    Then I should see "Visible page" in the "region-main" "region"
    And I should not see "Restricted page" in the "region-main" "region"
    And I should see "I am an unrestricted label" in the "region-main" "region"

    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I click on tile "1"
    And I wait until the page is ready

#    Now student can see the restricted page too
    Then I should see "Visible page" in the "region-main" "region"
    And I should see "Restricted page" in the "region-main" "region"
    And I should see "I am an unrestricted label" in the "region-main" "region"
